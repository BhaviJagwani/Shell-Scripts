Shell Scripts
==========

A collection of simple shell scripts that I find useful

recoverNames.sh: A script to rename mp3 files using the title tag in the metadata (Files generally get renamed on recovery using tools like photorec)

rotate.sh: A simple shell script which rotates all photos in the specified folder to their correct orientation
